# My first attempt at building a website

This is a website I made for my Web Development class. I choose NASA as a topic and tried to create my own version of the web page.
The content of the website was written in Croatian language.
Because of project guidelines, I had to use multiple frameworks like Bootstrap and Flexbox. 
The homepage has some information about missions, history and active partners. I also added hyperlinks for every topic which lead to the original NASA website. The website also has a contact page, about us page, news page (with information relevant at the time I was making the website, which was around mid 2022) and a web shop page. I also tried to make the website look as good and modern as possible at the time limited by my knowledge.
For example, I added a planet and blended it with the background of the website at the bottom of some pages.
Considering this was my first attempt at building a functional website, It was a valuable learning experience.
