# My first attempt at building a website

This is a website I made for my Web Development class. I choose NASA as a topic and tried to create my own version of the web page.
The website was written entirely in Croatian language.
Because of project guidelines, I had to use multiple frameworks like Bootstrap and Flexbox. 
The homepage has some information about missions, history and active partners. I also added hyperlinks for every topic which lead to the original NASA website. The website also has a contact page, about us page, news page (with information relevant at the time I was making the website, which was around mid 2022) and a web shop page with discounts (because why not). I also tried to make the website look as good and modern as possible, even though that was not one of the requirements of the task. 
For example, I added a planet and blended it with the background of the website at the bottom of some pages.
Considering this was my first attempt at building a functional website, It was a valuable learning experience.
I might also revisit this project in the future to improve it.
